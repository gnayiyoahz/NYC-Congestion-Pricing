# Overview

### Singapore's Electronic Road Pricing (ERP)

#### What is ERP

- ERP is an **Electronic Road Pricing System** used in **managing road congestion**. Based on a pay-as-you-use principle, motorists are charged when they use priced roads during peak hours.
- ERP rates vary for different roads and time periods depending on local traffic conditions. This encourages motorists to change their mode of transport, travel route or time of travel.

#### Benefits

- **Minimises traffic volume** in heavily used roads in the CBD and Orchard areas, as well as major expressways.
- **Optimises usage of the road network** by encouraging motorists to consider alternatives.
- **Provides a fair price for motorists.** Charges are based on usage—those who use the roads pay more; while those who use the roads less frequently or who travel during non-ERP hours pay less or don’t need to pay at all.
- **No more monthly/daily licences.**  Motorists no longer need to buy paper licences to drive through high traffic areas in the CBD.
- **No human error.** ERP’s reliable and fully automated system operates 24 hours. Its central computer system ensures gantries are always working properly.

#### Prices Determination

The ERP charges you pay depends on:

- Your Passenger Car Unit (PCU) equivalent
  - Cars, taxis and light goods vehicles are 1PCU. Motorcycles are 0.5PCU; heavy goods vehicles and small buses are 1.5PCU. Very heavy goods vehicles and big buses are 2PCU.

- The time you enter the restricted zone
  - During peak hours, charges change every half hour to take into account traffic volumes.
