# Overview of  ERP

### What is ERP

- The ERP (Electronic Road Pricing) was implemented by the [Land Transport Authority]( <https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en.html>) in September 1998.

- ERP is an Electronic Road Pricing System used in **managing road congestion**. 
- Charged when drivers use priced roads during peak hours.
- ERP rates vary for different roads and time periods depending on local traffic conditions. 

### Benefits

- **Minimises traffic volume** in heavily used roads in the CBD and Orchard areas, as well as major expressways.
- **Optimises usage of the road network** by encouraging motorists to consider alternatives.
- **Provides a fair price for motorists.** Charges are based on usage—those who use the roads pay more; while those who use the roads less frequently or who travel during non-ERP hours pay less or don’t need to pay at all.
- **No more monthly/daily licences.**  Motorists no longer need to buy paper licences to drive through high traffic areas in the CBD.
- **No human error.** ERP’s reliable and fully automated system operates 24 hours. Its central computer system ensures gantries are always working properly.

### Prices Determination

The ERP charges you pay depends on:

- Your Passenger Car Unit (PCU) equivalent
  - Cars, taxis and light goods vehicles are 1PCU. Motorcycles are 0.5PCU; heavy goods vehicles and small buses are 1.5PCU. Very heavy goods vehicles and big buses are 2PCU.

- The time you enter the restricted zone
  - During peak hours, charges change every half hour to take into account traffic volumes. 

### Chronology

- **Sep 1998 (First Implemented)** : ERP starts operating on weekdays with 33 gantries.
- Nov 1998: First revision to ERP rates (subsequently done at 3 months intervals)
- Apr 1999: ERP for city removed for Saturday
- Jun 1999: \$10 administrative fee + ERP charge for CashCard related violations (instead ofthe normal \$70 fine)
- Jul 1999: An extra ERP gantry for the city
- **Sep 1999 (Major Facility Improvement)**: 7 new ERP gantries on expressways and across the ring road
- Jul 2000: 1 new ERP gantry on an expressway
- Aug 2001: Enhancement of ERP gantries against Bluetooth operation, which also operates on the same radio frequency
- May 2002: 2 new ERP gantries on a radial road
- Feb 2003: Introduction of 5-min graduated rate change at ERP gantries where the difference in ERP charges between consecutive halfhours is \$1 or more
- Sep 2003: Option for foreign vehicles to pay a flat charge of ​\$10 per day for unlimited use
  of ERP priced road
- 2005: Saturday ERP in parts of the commercial areas added
- **2008 (Major Facility Improvement)**: 85th percentile speed used for determining ERP rates instead of average speeds (50th percentile); Number of gantries progressively introduced to 66; ERP rate changes to be in steps of S​\$1 instead of S\$50 cents
- 2009: Dual mode IU accepting contact and contactless smart cards made available; ERP credit card scheme3 was introduced.

### Basic Data

- Cost & Revenue
  - The capital cost of the ERP system, since its inception in September 1998 is S\$197 million and incurs an annual operational and maintenance cost of S​\$25 million for 66 control gantries (in 2009). 
  - The program’s annual revenue is estimated at S​\$144 million in 2008-09.
  - The ERP system starts with the installation of an in-vehicle unit (IU) in each of the ~900,000 vehicles in Singapore. The new IU costs about S​$155 and is powered by the vehicle battery. 	



# Potential Investigation

### Price Determination

#### 	Government: Revenue Maximization



### Impact 

#### 	Taxi Industry

- ERP fares paid by taxi drivers

- Based on the analysis of the Taxi data, the number of taxis started to drop significantly at the end of 2016/beginning of 2017.

#### 	Public Transport



#### 	Carparks (?)

- Revenue?

#### 	Uber Drivers

- To maximize profits, need to consider
  - When to drive
  - Where to drive
  - Cost of driving on a low-priced road (time, gas) vs on a pricey road (depends on how effective the congestion pricing scheme is)

#### General Drivers

- Drive vs Public transport decision
  - Cost of driving: congestion price, parking
  - Time
- Potential product: map?
